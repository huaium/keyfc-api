## Example

Let's say you want to fetch data from the forum page with ID `52`:

```kotlin
val result: Result<ForumPage> =
    // Run in a coroutine scope, required by login and fetchForum
    runBlocking {
        KeyfcClient()
            // Assume you've got username and password as String
            .apply { login(username, password) }
            .use { it.fetchForum("52") }
    }

result.fold(
    onSuccess = { forumPage ->
        // Do something with the forum page
    },
    onFailure = { exception ->
        // Handle the exception
    }
)
```
